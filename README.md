# Manufacturing Efficiency Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes manufacturing efficiency using two datasets:
1. **Employee Details Dataset** – Contains employee demographics, department distribution, salary, performance ratings, and tenure.
2. **Product Details Dataset** – Includes production costs, product types, warehouse efficiency, and country-based data.

The goal is to uncover insights that can improve productivity, optimize costs, and enhance workforce efficiency.
